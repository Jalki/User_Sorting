# User_Sorting
User Sorting Plugin I made as a coding test


The goal of this WordPress plugin is to gather a list of users from another 3d party plugin, sort them based on user input, and then print out a list of them. 
Then upon clicking on the linked user, it will forward you to a new webpage where details about said user is given like a place holder picture, birthday, name, location, and favorite food.
